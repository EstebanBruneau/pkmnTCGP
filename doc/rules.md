Here’s a **comprehensive breakdown of the PvP combat system** in **Pokémon TCG Pocket**, focusing **only on battle mechanics**—no fluff about collection, packs, or menus.

---

## 🎯 Win Condition & Deck Structure

* **Deck size**: 20 cards (Pokémon + Trainers). No Energy cards in your deck.
* **Bench slots**: 1 Active Pokémon + up to 3 Benched Pokémon. 
* **Points instead of Prize cards**:

  * Defeat a basic Pokémon → **1 point**
  * Defeat a Pokémon‑ex → **2 points**
  * First to **3 points wins**.

---

## 🔋 Energy System (“Energy Zone”)

* No Energy cards. Instead, you get **1 Energy token automatically from your Energy Zone per turn**.
* **Energy Zone behavior**:

  * Offers type based on your deck’s Pokémon types, but it's possible to change the energy type however a player likes, if 2 types are in a deck then it generates a random energy each turn, it always show the next turn's energy type to the player.
  * Tokens are consumed when attacking, retreating, or via Trainer effects—and **don’t refresh**.

## ⚙️ Game Turn Flow

Each player’s turn (except going-first, who skips the draw) follows this sequence:

1. **Draw a card** • 
2. **Gain 1 Energy** from Energy Zone (1st player to play the 1st turn gets 0 energy this turn only)
3. **Activate Evolutions** (once per Pokémon per turn, not on same turn it entered)
4. **Play Basic Pokémon** to Bench (if slots available)
5. **Use Pokémon Abilities** – if your Active or Benched Pokémon has one
6. **Play Trainers**:

   * Unlimited **Items**
   * Up to **1 Supporter** per turn
7. **Retreat**: switch Active ↔ Bench (cost in Energy tokens) – once per turn
8. **Attack**: requires meeting attack's Energy cost

   * Calculate damage (base + modifiers)
   * Knockouts earn points
9. **Status effects** and other after‑attack triggers
10. **Pass turn** to opponent

## 🔁 Combat Flow of a Game

1. Coin flip decides who goes 1st.
2. Each player draws an opening **hand of 5 cards**, places their Active Pokémon, and fills the Bench (0 to 3). 
3. Battles proceed with the above turn structure.
4. Battle continues until someone hits **3 points** from knockouts.
5. No deck-out loss—game ends on points only.&#x20;

## 🛡️ Mechanics & Specific Rules

### Weakness

* If Active is weak to attacker, add **+20 damage** flat. 
  *(No multipliers like physical TCG x2)*

### No Resistance

* Resistance traits are **removed** for simplification.&#x20;

### Status Conditions

Consistent with core TCG but simplified: 

* **Poison**: –10 HP each turn
* **Burn**: –20 HP each turn, coin flip to heal
* **Sleep**: skip attack/retreat; coin flip to wake
* **Paralysis**: skip attack/retreat; clears after one turn
* **Confusion**: 50% chance attack fails (coin flip)

### Evolution Rules

* Cannot evolve the pokemon if we are the turn this Pokémon is played.
* One evolution per Pokémon per turn. 

### Trainers & Abilities

* **Items**: unlimited per turn; go to discard after use.
* **Supporters**: only one per turn.
* **Tools**: attach one per Pokémon, like Item attachments. 
* **Abilities**: manual activation when allowed (usually before attack).

### Retreat

* One retreat per turn (must pay Energy token cost).
* No retreat → can't attack with some Pokémon.

## 🔄 PvP Match Flow

* Turn order alternates until someone reaches **3 points**.
* No prize or deck exhaustion involved.
* A **tiebreaker**: typically the first to edge out remains winner—ties are rare since deck sizes small. Ranked matches handle ties via draws, with no rank change.
